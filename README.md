## learnCPP


Just have a basic of C plus plus,the reason I upload my code is to learn to use github while learning C plus plus. 


================= update on Sep,1,2016 ================

Before view this repo,the first thing you should know is that **the repo is not a project**.

As the file name tells,it just contains some cpp programs,most of which are from "C++ Primer,5th".

In order to make everything more clear,I am trying to update a list of programs which  are helpful and useful while I was learning.   


1) **/code/L06 - KMeans**.A course design of Data Structure which is implemented by cpp, it took me 1 week to finish it.But the final grade made me a little upset: I just got an "A-".Actually I think it deserves a higher rank.

Here is a brief introduction of K-Means algorithm: K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, it aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to cluster with the nearset mean.

2)**/code/L08 IO/fileIO**.A simple program which shows us how to pass parameters to the main() function.

3)**code/L11 Associative Container/word_transform**.A word_transform program.Go to the directory above(which contains a "readme.md" file) if you want to get more details about this program.
