Before you enter this repo,the first thing you should know is that **this repo is not a project**.
As the file name tells,it just contains some cpp codes,most of them are from "C++ Primer,5th".

I highly recommend you read these examples:

1) **/code/L06 - KMeans**. It's a course design of Data Structure implemented by cpp, it took me 1 week to implement this algorithm,but the final grade made me a little sad: I just got an "A-".Actually I think it deserves a higher rank.
Here is a brief introduction of K-Means algorithm: K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, it aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to cluster with the nearset mean.
